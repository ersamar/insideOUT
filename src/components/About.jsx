          Hello, and welcome to my personal space on the internet. My name is Ersa Amar, and I am a web developer, designer, and creative thinker. While I find joy in creating beautiful and functional digital experiences, I often navigate through my work and life with a companion that many might not see â€“ anxiety. There are days when even the simplest tasks can feel overwhelming, and self-doubt tends to creep in at every turn. Despite this, I strive to pour my heart and soul into every piece of work I create, hoping to turn my inner turmoil into something meaningful and impactful.
